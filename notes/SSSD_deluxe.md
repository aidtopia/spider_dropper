I think ChatGPT nailed it with its first suggestion.  "Sophisticated" was already on my short list.

Me:

I've engineered a Halloween prop that drops a toy spider from the ceiling to startle trick-or-treaters.  I intentionally used the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid), so I named it the Stupidly Simple Spider Dropper, or SSSD for short.  Once it worked, I was inspired to add one feature.  The enhanced version works on the same basic principle, so it's still relatively simple.  As I joke, I dubbed that one the Slightly Smarter Spider Dropper, so it is also known as SSSD.  Now I'm working on a deluxe version that abandons the simple operating procedure and has been utterly over-engineered from the ground up.  In the same vein as its predecessors, it deserves a tongue-in-cheek name, like the Egregiously Engineered Spider Dropper or the Considerably Complicated Spider Dropper.  But I'd really like to pick a name that abbreviates to SSSD.  So I'm looking for a pair of "S" words that conveys the sense of overly-complicated or over-designed.

ChatGPT:

This sounds like such a fun project! You’ve got the right attitude for a Halloween prop that has this much character.

Here are a few ideas for SSSD names that convey that over-engineered vibe while keeping the playful tone:

1. **Superfluously Sophisticated Spider Dropper**
   (This plays up the "too much" angle—superfluous being excessive or unnecessary, and sophisticated being over-the-top in design.)

2. **Supremely Sophisticated Spider Dropper**
   (Similar to above but with a touch of grandeur, like it’s got way more flair than it needs.)

3. **Sensationally Scintillating Spider Dropper**
   (This takes the over-the-top, flashy, and showy route—perfect for a deluxe version.)

4. **Staggeringly Sophisticated Spider Dropper**
   (For a real "wow" factor, implying the complexity is almost mind-blowing.)

5. **Seriously Superfluous Spider Dropper**
   (You could get a chuckle out of this one, since "seriously" implies it's actually serious about its excessive nature.)

6. **Savagely Superfluous Spider Dropper**
   (Has a bit more punch to it, as if it's designed with reckless abandon and no concern for simplicity.)

Let me know if any of these work for you, or if you’re looking for something with a slightly different tone!
